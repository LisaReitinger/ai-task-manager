# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Task Management Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core task management functionality including task CRUD operations, status tracking, and basic task display.
# Details:
1. Create TaskService with API functions for task operations
2. Implement TaskList component to display tasks for a selected project
3. Create TaskItem component to display individual task details
4. Implement task creation form with fields for title, description, priority, and due date
5. Add task status management (not_started, in_progress, completed)
6. Implement task editing functionality
7. Create task deletion with confirmation
8. Add basic task ordering by creation date or priority
9. Ensure all components use the Task interface defined in the PRD
10. Implement task count and basic progress calculation
11. Add estimated hours and actual hours tracking

# Test Strategy:
Test task creation, editing, and deletion. Verify task status changes are reflected immediately. Test task listing with various filters. Verify task ordering works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop TaskService with CRUD API Functions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a TaskService module that provides API functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, ensuring all operations conform to the Task interface defined in the PRD.
### Details:
The TaskService should handle all backend interactions for task management, including endpoints for task creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. It must support status updates, ordering, and hours tracking.

## 2. Implement TaskList Component for Project-Based Display [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a TaskList UI component that displays tasks associated with a selected project, supporting ordering by creation date or priority.
### Details:
The TaskList should fetch tasks from TaskService, display them in a list, and allow sorting by creation date or priority. It must update in real-time as tasks are added, edited, or deleted.

## 3. Create TaskItem Component for Individual Task Details [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Develop a TaskItem component to render individual task details, including title, description, priority, status, due date, estimated hours, and actual hours.
### Details:
TaskItem should support inline status updates, display all relevant fields, and provide controls for editing and deleting the task.

## 4. Implement Task Creation and Editing Forms [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Build forms for creating and editing tasks, including fields for title, description, priority, due date, estimated hours, and actual hours.
### Details:
Forms should validate input, support both creation and editing modes, and integrate with TaskService for data persistence.

## 5. Add Task Status Management and Progress Calculation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Implement logic for managing task statuses (not_started, in_progress, completed) and calculate basic progress metrics such as task count and completion percentage.
### Details:
Status changes should be reflected in both the UI and backend. Progress calculation should aggregate task statuses for display in the TaskList.
