# Subtasks:
## 1. Enhance ThemeProvider Context with Persistence and System Preference Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Extend the ThemeProvider context to support theme persistence (e.g., localStorage) and detect the user's system preference for initial theme selection.
### Details:
Implement logic to store and retrieve the selected theme from persistent storage. Add detection for system color scheme preference and use it as the initial theme if no preference is stored.

## 2. Configure Tailwind CSS and Centralize Theme Variables [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Set up Tailwind CSS for dark mode using the 'class' strategy and define theme color variables in a central configuration.
### Details:
Update Tailwind configuration to enable dark mode via class. Create a central file for theme color variables to ensure consistency across components.

## 3. Implement ThemeToggle Component with Animated Transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Develop a ThemeToggle UI component that allows users to switch between light and dark modes, including a smooth 200ms transition animation.
### Details:
Create a toggle button that updates the theme context and triggers a CSS transition for theme changes. Ensure the animation duration matches the specification.

## 4. Apply Theme Styles and Ensure Accessibility Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Update all components to support both themes, verify contrast ratios meet WCAG 2.1 AA, and add theme-specific focus styles for keyboard navigation.
### Details:
Audit all UI components for proper styling in both light and dark modes. Use automated tools to check color contrast and add accessible focus indicators.

## 5. Implement Theme Preview and Consistency Across Custom Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Add a theme preview feature in user preferences and ensure the theme system consistently affects all custom components.
### Details:
Develop a preview section where users can see both themes before applying. Review all custom components to guarantee theme variables and styles are applied uniformly.
