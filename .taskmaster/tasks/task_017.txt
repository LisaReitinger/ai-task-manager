# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Resilience
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 7, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive error handling system with error boundaries, user feedback, and recovery mechanisms.
# Details:
1. Implement React Error Boundary components at strategic levels
2. Create ErrorFallback component for graceful degradation
3. Implement toast notification system for user feedback
4. Add global error handler for uncaught exceptions
5. Create retry mechanisms for failed API calls
6. Implement offline detection and recovery
7. Add validation for all user inputs
8. Create meaningful error messages for different error types
9. Implement logging service for error tracking
10. Add recovery options for common error scenarios
11. Create error reporting mechanism for users to submit bug reports

# Test Strategy:
Test error boundaries with simulated component errors. Verify API error handling with mocked failed requests. Test offline recovery mechanisms. Verify error messages are clear and actionable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Strategic React Error Boundaries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and integrate React Error Boundary components at key locations in the component tree to catch and handle rendering errors without crashing the entire application.
### Details:
Create class-based Error Boundary components using getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch. Place boundaries around independent features or layouts to isolate failures and maintain overall app stability.

## 2. Design and Integrate Custom Error Fallback UIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create user-friendly ErrorFallback components that provide clear, actionable feedback and recovery options when errors occur.
### Details:
Develop fallback UIs tailored to different app sections, ensuring messages are informative and guide users on next steps (e.g., retry, reload, contact support). Integrate these with error boundaries.

## 3. Implement Global Error and Exception Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a global error handler to catch uncaught exceptions and promise rejections, ensuring all errors are logged and surfaced to users appropriately.
### Details:
Configure window.onerror and window.onunhandledrejection handlers to capture errors outside React's rendering lifecycle. Integrate with logging and notification systems.

## 4. Develop User Feedback and Notification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3
### Description: Implement a toast notification system to inform users of errors, warnings, and recovery actions in real time.
### Details:
Integrate a toast or snackbar library to display contextual error messages and status updates. Ensure notifications are accessible and non-intrusive.

## 5. Create Automated Recovery and Retry Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Develop mechanisms to automatically retry failed API calls and provide users with manual recovery options for common error scenarios.
### Details:
Implement exponential backoff and retry logic for network/API failures. Offer UI controls for users to retry failed actions or recover from offline states.
