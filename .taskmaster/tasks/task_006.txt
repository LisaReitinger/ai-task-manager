# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a dashboard view that provides an overview of all projects with progress indicators and key metrics.
# Details:
1. Design and implement Dashboard component as the main landing page after login
2. Create ProjectSummary component to display condensed project information
3. Implement progress visualization components:
   - CircularProgress component for project completion percentage
   - LinearProgress component for task completion
4. Add project statistics section showing:
   - Total number of projects by status
   - Recently updated projects
   - Projects approaching deadlines
5. Implement dashboard filters for viewing different project subsets
6. Create responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS grid classes
7. Add quick-action buttons for creating new projects and accessing recent projects
8. Implement skeleton loading states for dashboard elements
9. Ensure all dashboard components are fully responsive

# Test Strategy:
Test dashboard rendering with various numbers of projects. Verify progress indicators accurately reflect project completion. Test responsive layout at different screen sizes. Verify dashboard filters correctly display filtered projects.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Dashboard Goals, KPIs, and Data Sources [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Clarify the dashboard's purpose, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and catalog all relevant data sources to ensure the dashboard provides actionable insights and aligns with user needs.
### Details:
Work with stakeholders to determine the main objectives of the dashboard, select the most important KPIs (such as project completion rates, project status counts, and deadlines), and list all data sources required for real-time and accurate reporting.

## 2. Design Dashboard Layout and Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create wireframes and UI designs for the dashboard, including the main layout, ProjectSummary, progress visualization, statistics, filters, and quick-action buttons.
### Details:
Design an intuitive, user-friendly layout using responsive grid principles. Specify the placement and interaction of each component, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation.

## 3. Implement Dashboard Data Integration and State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Develop the logic to fetch, aggregate, and manage project data for all dashboard components, ensuring real-time updates and accurate metric calculations.
### Details:
Integrate with backend APIs or data sources to retrieve project information, progress metrics, and statistics. Implement state management to handle data updates, filtering, and loading states.

## 4. Develop and Integrate Visualization and Interaction Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Build and connect the CircularProgress, LinearProgress, ProjectSummary, statistics, filters, and quick-action components, ensuring they are interactive and visually consistent.
### Details:
Implement each visualization and interaction component according to design specifications. Ensure components are accessible, responsive, and provide clear feedback (including skeleton loading states).

## 5. Finalize Responsive Layout and Conduct End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Apply responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS, ensure all dashboard elements adapt to different screen sizes, and perform comprehensive end-to-end testing.
### Details:
Refine the dashboard layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Conduct thorough testing to validate responsiveness, data accuracy, filter functionality, and overall user experience.
