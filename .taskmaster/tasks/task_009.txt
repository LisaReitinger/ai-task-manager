# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement drag and drop functionality for visual task prioritization and reordering using react-beautiful-dnd.
# Details:
1. Install and configure react-beautiful-dnd: `npm install react-beautiful-dnd @types/react-beautiful-dnd`
2. Create DraggableTaskList component that wraps TaskList
3. Implement Droppable container for task lists
4. Create Draggable wrapper for TaskItem components
5. Implement reordering logic to update task order property
6. Add visual feedback during drag operations
7. Create API function to persist new task order
8. Implement optimistic UI updates for drag operations
9. Add keyboard accessibility for drag and drop operations
10. Handle edge cases like dragging between different status columns
11. Ensure smooth animations during drag operations with CSS transitions

# Test Strategy:
Test drag and drop functionality between different positions. Verify task order is persisted after page refresh. Test keyboard accessibility for drag operations. Verify visual feedback during drag operations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure react-beautiful-dnd [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the project by installing react-beautiful-dnd and its type definitions, and configure the DragDropContext at the root of the relevant component tree.
### Details:
Run `npm install react-beautiful-dnd @types/react-beautiful-dnd` and wrap the main task list component with DragDropContext, providing an onDragEnd handler.

## 2. Implement Droppable Task List Container [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a Droppable component to define the area where tasks can be reordered via drag and drop.
### Details:
Wrap the task list in a Droppable component, assign a unique droppableId, and apply provided props and refs to the container element.

## 3. Wrap Task Items with Draggable Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Make each TaskItem draggable by wrapping it in a Draggable component and assigning unique draggableIds.
### Details:
Map over the task list and render each TaskItem inside a Draggable, passing the required index and draggableId props.

## 4. Implement Task Reordering Logic and State Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Handle the onDragEnd event to update the task order in state and persist changes via API.
### Details:
Write the onDragEnd handler to reorder tasks in local state, trigger optimistic UI updates, and call an API function to persist the new order.

## 5. Enhance Accessibility and Visual Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Add keyboard accessibility for drag operations and implement visual feedback such as highlighting and smooth animations.
### Details:
Ensure keyboard controls work for drag and drop, add CSS transitions for smooth movement, and provide visual cues during drag operations.
