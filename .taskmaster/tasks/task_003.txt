# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a complete authentication system with user registration, login, JWT token management, and protected routes.
# Details:
1. Install required packages: `npm install jwt-decode axios react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers`
2. Create authentication API service with functions for:
   - register(email, password, name)
   - login(email, password)
   - logout()
   - refreshToken()
3. Implement JWT token storage in localStorage with proper security measures
4. Complete the AuthProvider context with:
   - User state management
   - Login/logout functions
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - Loading and error states
5. Create LoginPage and RegisterPage components with form validation using react-hook-form and zod
6. Implement ProtectedRoute component that redirects to login if not authenticated
7. Add form validation with error messages
8. Implement session persistence across page refreshes
9. Add password strength requirements and validation

# Test Strategy:
Test registration and login flows with valid and invalid credentials. Verify JWT token storage and retrieval. Test protected routes redirect correctly when not authenticated. Verify form validation works correctly for all input fields.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Authentication API Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop an authentication API service with functions for user registration, login, logout, and token refresh. Ensure secure communication with the backend and proper error handling.
### Details:
Implement API functions: register(email, password, name), login(email, password), logout(), and refreshToken(). Use axios for HTTP requests and handle API errors gracefully.

## 2. Implement JWT Token Storage and Security [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Store JWT tokens securely in localStorage and implement measures to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as XSS and token leakage.
### Details:
Save JWT tokens to localStorage upon successful authentication. Implement logic to clear tokens on logout and handle token expiration. Consider using httpOnly cookies if backend supports it.

## 3. Develop AuthProvider Context for State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create an AuthProvider using React Context to manage user state, authentication status, login/logout functions, token refresh, and loading/error states across the app.
### Details:
Implement context provider that exposes user state, authentication actions, and handles session persistence. Integrate token refresh logic and manage loading/error indicators.

## 4. Build Authentication UI Components with Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create LoginPage and RegisterPage components with forms using react-hook-form and zod for validation, including password strength requirements and error messages.
### Details:
Design and implement login and registration forms with real-time validation feedback. Enforce password strength and display validation errors clearly.

## 5. Implement Protected Routes and Session Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Create a ProtectedRoute component that restricts access to authenticated users and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page. Ensure session persists across page refreshes.
### Details:
Use React Router to guard protected routes. Check authentication status from AuthProvider and redirect as needed. Implement logic to restore user session from stored JWT on app load.
