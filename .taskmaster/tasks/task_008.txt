# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Subtask Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the task management system to support hierarchical subtasks with proper parent-child relationships.
# Details:
1. Update TaskItem component to display subtasks
2. Create SubtaskList component for rendering child tasks
3. Implement subtask creation form within a parent task
4. Add visual indentation for subtask hierarchy
5. Implement cascade completion (completing a parent completes all children)
6. Add subtask count to parent tasks
7. Create collapsible subtask lists
8. Update progress calculation to include subtask completion
9. Ensure proper data structure for parent-child relationships using the parentTaskId field
10. Add ability to convert subtasks to main tasks and vice versa
11. Implement drag and drop for subtask reordering within a parent

# Test Strategy:
Test subtask creation and display. Verify parent-child relationships are maintained correctly. Test cascade completion functionality. Verify progress calculation includes subtasks correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Data Structure for Hierarchical Subtasks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement a data model that supports parent-child relationships between tasks and subtasks, ensuring each subtask references its parent via a parentTaskId field.
### Details:
Update the backend and data schema to allow tasks to have multiple levels of subtasks, maintaining clear parent-child links. Ensure the structure supports operations like creation, deletion, and conversion between main tasks and subtasks.

## 2. Implement Subtask Creation and Display Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop UI components for creating subtasks within a parent task and displaying them in a hierarchical, indented list.
### Details:
Update the TaskItem component to render subtasks. Create a SubtaskList component to display child tasks with visual indentation. Add a subtask creation form within the parent task view.

## 3. Implement Cascade Completion and Progress Calculation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Ensure that completing a parent task marks all its subtasks as complete, and update progress calculations to include subtask completion.
### Details:
Add logic so that when a parent task is marked complete, all child subtasks are also completed. Update progress indicators to reflect the completion status of subtasks.

## 4. Add Subtask Management Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement features for subtask count display, collapsible subtask lists, and the ability to convert subtasks to main tasks and vice versa.
### Details:
Display the number of subtasks on parent tasks. Allow users to collapse or expand subtask lists. Provide UI and logic to convert a subtask to a main task and vice versa.

## 5. Enable Subtask Reordering with Drag and Drop [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement drag and drop functionality to reorder subtasks within a parent task, updating their order in the data structure.
### Details:
Integrate a drag and drop library to allow users to reorder subtasks visually. Update the backend to persist the new order.
