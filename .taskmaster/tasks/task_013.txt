# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Progress Visualization Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create visual progress indicators for projects and tasks including progress bars, completion percentages, and circular progress indicators.
# Details:
1. Create CircularProgress component for project cards using SVG
2. Implement LinearProgress component for task lists
3. Add numerical percentage indicators alongside visual components
4. Create progress calculation utilities for projects and task lists
5. Implement color coding based on progress percentage
6. Add animations for progress changes
7. Ensure all progress components are accessible with proper ARIA attributes
8. Create ProjectProgress component that aggregates task completion
9. Implement TaskProgress component for subtask progress
10. Add hover tooltips with detailed progress information
11. Ensure all progress components work correctly in both themes

# Test Strategy:
Test progress calculation with various task completion scenarios. Verify visual indicators accurately reflect calculated progress. Test accessibility of progress components with screen readers. Verify animations work correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Core Progress Visualization Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement reusable visual components for displaying project and task progress, including circular and linear progress indicators using SVG and standard UI elements.
### Details:
Create CircularProgress and LinearProgress components to visually represent progress on project cards and task lists, ensuring modularity and reusability.

## 2. Implement Progress Calculation Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop utility functions to accurately calculate progress percentages for projects and task lists, including aggregation of subtask completion.
### Details:
Create functions that compute overall progress based on completed and total tasks or subtasks, supporting both individual and aggregated views.

## 3. Integrate Numerical and Color-Coded Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Enhance visual components by displaying numerical percentage values and applying color coding based on progress thresholds.
### Details:
Add numerical percentage labels next to progress bars and circles, and implement dynamic color changes (e.g., red/yellow/green) to reflect progress status.

## 4. Add Animations and Accessibility Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.3
### Description: Implement smooth animations for progress changes and ensure all components are accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
### Details:
Apply animated transitions to progress updates and add ARIA roles, labels, and keyboard support to meet accessibility standards.

## 5. Enhance User Interaction and Theming Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Add interactive features such as hover tooltips with detailed progress information and ensure all components support both light and dark themes.
### Details:
Implement tooltips that display additional progress details on hover and verify that all visual elements adapt correctly to theme changes.
