# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement AI Service Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate with an AI service to enable natural language processing for task generation from project descriptions.
# Details:
1. Research and select an appropriate AI API (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, etc.)
2. Create AIService with functions for communicating with the chosen API
3. Implement prompt engineering to format requests for optimal task breakdown
4. Create TaskGenerationForm component for user input
5. Implement response parsing to convert AI output to Task objects
6. Add error handling for API failures and rate limiting
7. Implement loading states during AI processing
8. Create retry mechanism for failed requests
9. Add validation of AI-generated tasks before saving
10. Implement feedback mechanism for improving AI responses
11. Consider implementing a fallback to local task templates if AI service is unavailable

# Test Strategy:
Test AI task generation with various project descriptions. Verify generated tasks follow the required format. Test error handling with simulated API failures. Verify rate limiting handling works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research and Select AI Service Provider [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate and choose the most suitable AI API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic Claude) for natural language processing based on performance, features, pricing, and integration requirements.
### Details:
Compare leading AI APIs on criteria such as model capabilities, context window size, safety features, pricing, and ease of integration. Document the rationale for the selected provider.

## 2. Develop AIService Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement a service module to handle communication with the selected AI API, including authentication, request formatting, and response handling.
### Details:
Create reusable functions for sending prompts and receiving responses. Ensure secure handling of API keys and support for future extensibility.

## 3. Implement Prompt Engineering Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Design and implement prompt templates and formatting logic to optimize AI-generated task breakdowns from project descriptions.
### Details:
Develop prompt structures that yield clear, actionable, and well-structured task lists. Iterate on prompt design based on output quality.

## 4. Build Task Generation User Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Create a user-facing form component for submitting project descriptions and initiating AI-powered task generation.
### Details:
Design and implement a responsive form with input validation, loading indicators, and error messaging. Integrate with the AIService module.

## 5. Parse and Validate AI Output into Task Objects [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Develop logic to parse AI-generated responses into structured Task objects, including validation and error handling.
### Details:
Implement parsing routines to extract tasks from AI output, handle edge cases, and ensure data integrity before saving.
