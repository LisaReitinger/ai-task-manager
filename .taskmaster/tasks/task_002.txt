# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Base Component Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational component structure including routing, layout components, and context providers as outlined in the technical architecture.
# Details:
1. Install React Router: `npm install react-router-dom@6`
2. Create AuthProvider context with initial placeholder functionality
3. Create ThemeProvider context with light/dark theme toggle functionality
4. Set up Router component with basic routes for Login, Register, and Dashboard
5. Create placeholder components for each route
6. Implement basic layout components (Sidebar, Header, etc.)
7. Create shared components:
   - ThemeToggle: Toggle button for switching between light and dark themes
   - LoadingSpinner: Reusable loading indicator
   - Modal: Reusable modal component using Headless UI
8. Implement responsive layout with Tailwind CSS breakpoints
9. Set up lazy loading for route components using React.lazy() and Suspense

# Test Strategy:
Test component rendering with React Testing Library. Verify that routes are correctly configured and navigable. Ensure context providers properly wrap the application and provide expected values to consumers.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Routing Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install React Router v6 and configure the application's routing context using BrowserRouter. Establish the foundational routing structure for the app.
### Details:
Run 'npm install react-router-dom@6'. Wrap the root component with <BrowserRouter> to enable client-side routing. Prepare the project for route definitions and navigation.

## 2. Implement Context Providers [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create and integrate AuthProvider and ThemeProvider contexts to manage authentication state and theme toggling across the application.
### Details:
Develop AuthProvider with placeholder authentication logic and ThemeProvider with light/dark theme toggle functionality. Ensure both providers wrap the app and expose context values.

## 3. Define Core Routes and Placeholder Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Set up the Router component with basic routes for Login, Register, and Dashboard. Create placeholder components for each route.
### Details:
Use <Routes> and <Route> to define paths for Login, Register, and Dashboard. Implement simple placeholder components for each route to confirm navigation.

## 4. Develop Layout and Shared UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Implement basic layout components (Sidebar, Header) and shared components (ThemeToggle, LoadingSpinner, Modal) for consistent UI structure and functionality.
### Details:
Create Sidebar and Header components for the main layout. Build ThemeToggle for theme switching, LoadingSpinner for loading states, and Modal using Headless UI for dialogs.

## 5. Enable Responsive Design and Performance Enhancements [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Implement responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS breakpoints and set up lazy loading for route components with React.lazy() and Suspense.
### Details:
Apply Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design in layout components. Use React.lazy() and Suspense to load route components asynchronously for improved performance.
