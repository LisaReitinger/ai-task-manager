   - Priority (low, medium, high)
   - Due date ranges
   - Project selection
2. Implement SearchBar component for text-based searching

# Test Strategy:
Test filtering with various combinations of filters. Verify search functionality finds relevant tasks. Test URL parameter synchronization. Verify filter state is maintained during navigation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement TaskFilters and SearchBar Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the TaskFilters component with options for status, priority, due date ranges, and project selection, and create the SearchBar component for text-based searching.
### Details:
Ensure filters are user-friendly, support progressive disclosure, and allow for both single and multiple selections as appropriate. The SearchBar should support auto-suggestions and keyboard navigation for accessibility.

## 2. Implement Filter State Management and Client-side Filtering Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create state management for filters and search queries within TaskContext and implement logic to filter tasks on the client side based on selected criteria.
### Details:
Ensure that filter state is centralized, supports dynamic updates, and that filtering logic efficiently narrows down tasks according to all active filters and search terms.

## 3. Synchronize Filter State with URL Parameters [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Enable synchronization of filter and search state with URL parameters to allow sharing and bookmarking of filtered task views.
### Details:
Implement logic to read from and write to URL parameters when filters or search terms change, ensuring state is preserved on navigation and reload.

## 4. Add SavedFilters, Clear Filters, and Visual Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Implement functionality for saving frequently used filter combinations, a button to clear all filters, and visual indicators to show which filters are active.
### Details:
Allow users to save and quickly apply filter sets, provide a clear filters button, and visually highlight active filters for clarity.

## 5. Optimize for Performance, Accessibility, and Responsiveness [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Implement debounced search input, keyboard shortcuts for common filter actions, and ensure all filter components are responsive and accessible on mobile devices.
### Details:
Debounce search input to reduce unnecessary filtering, add keyboard shortcuts for efficiency, and ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes and is accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
