# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize application performance with code splitting, memoization, virtualization, and efficient rendering strategies.
# Details:
1. Implement code splitting using React.lazy() and Suspense
2. Add memoization for expensive calculations using useMemo and useCallback
3. Implement virtualized lists for large task collections using react-window
4. Optimize re-renders with React.memo for pure components
5. Add debouncing for search and filter inputs
6. Implement optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
7. Add skeleton loading states for async operations
8. Optimize images and assets with proper sizing and formats
9. Implement efficient state management to prevent unnecessary renders
10. Add performance monitoring using web vitals
11. Implement prefetching for likely user navigation paths

# Test Strategy:
Measure and compare performance metrics before and after optimizations. Test with large datasets to verify virtualization works correctly. Verify code splitting reduces initial bundle size. Test optimistic UI updates for common actions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Route-Based and Component-Based Code Splitting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply code splitting using React.lazy() and Suspense for both routes and large, non-critical components to reduce initial bundle size and improve load times.
### Details:
Identify distinct routes and large components that are not essential for initial rendering. Use React.lazy() to dynamically import these components and wrap them with Suspense to provide fallback UIs. Ensure that critical UI elements remain eagerly loaded for optimal user experience.

## 2. Add Memoization for Expensive Calculations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize performance by memoizing expensive calculations and functions using useMemo and useCallback hooks.
### Details:
Identify components and functions that perform heavy computations or are frequently re-created. Wrap these with useMemo or useCallback to prevent unnecessary recalculations and re-renders.

## 3. Implement Virtualized Lists for Large Collections [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use react-window to virtualize rendering of large task lists, ensuring only visible items are rendered to the DOM.
### Details:
Replace standard list rendering with react-window components for task collections that may contain many items. Configure item size and overscan settings for smooth scrolling and performance.

## 4. Optimize Component Re-Renders with React.memo [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Wrap pure functional components with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders when props have not changed.
### Details:
Identify stateless components that receive props but do not need to re-render unless those props change. Wrap these components with React.memo and, if needed, provide custom comparison functions.

## 5. Add Debouncing for Search and Filter Inputs [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement debouncing logic for search and filter input fields to reduce the frequency of expensive operations during rapid user input.
### Details:
Wrap search and filter handlers with a debounce utility to delay execution until the user has stopped typing. Choose an appropriate debounce interval to balance responsiveness and performance.
