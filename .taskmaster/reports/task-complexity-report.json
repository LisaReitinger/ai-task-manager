		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup into subtasks covering: Vite project scaffolding, TypeScript configuration, Tailwind CSS installation and setup, Headless UI and react-beautiful-dnd installation, ESLint and Prettier setup, TypeScript strict mode configuration, folder structure creation, and Git repository initialization.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a modern React project with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS is a well-documented process with clear steps and tooling support. However, it involves multiple configuration steps and integrations (linting, formatting, folder structure, and version control) that should be handled as discrete subtasks for clarity and maintainability. Industry best practices recommend explicit setup for each tool to ensure reproducibility and onboarding ease.[1][2][3]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Base Component Architecture",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks for: React Router setup, AuthProvider context, ThemeProvider context, Router component with routes, placeholder route components, layout components (Sidebar, Header), shared components (ThemeToggle, LoadingSpinner, Modal), responsive layout implementation, and lazy loading for routes.",
			"reasoning": "Establishing the foundational architecture requires careful planning of routing, context providers, and shared UI components. Each area (routing, context, layout, shared components, responsiveness, and code splitting) is a distinct concern and should be implemented and tested separately to ensure modularity and scalability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose authentication into subtasks: dependency installation, API service creation, JWT storage and security, AuthProvider completion, LoginPage and RegisterPage with validation, ProtectedRoute implementation, error and loading state handling, session persistence, password validation, and integration testing.",
			"reasoning": "Authentication involves multiple security-sensitive flows (registration, login, token management, protected routing, validation, and persistence). Each flow has unique requirements and edge cases, and best practices dictate isolating these for robust testing and maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Project Management Core",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: ProjectService API functions, ProjectList component, project card UI, status indicators, ProjectForm for create/edit, ProjectView container, status toggle logic, ProjectContext state management, project deletion with confirmation, sorting options, and interface typing.",
			"reasoning": "Project management core covers CRUD operations, state management, UI components, and user interactions. Each aspect (API, UI, state, sorting, deletion) is a separate concern and should be implemented as a subtask to ensure clarity and testability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Project Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for: Dashboard component design, ProjectSummary component, progress visualization (circular/linear), project statistics section, dashboard filters, responsive grid layout, quick-action buttons, skeleton loading states, and responsiveness testing.",
			"reasoning": "The dashboard aggregates and visualizes project data, requiring distinct components for summaries, progress, statistics, filtering, and responsive design. Each visualization and interaction should be handled as a subtask for modularity and maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Subtask Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: TaskItem subtask display, SubtaskList component, subtask creation form, visual hierarchy/indentation, cascade completion logic, subtask count, collapsible lists, progress calculation update, parent-child data structure, conversion between subtask/main task, and drag-and-drop reordering.",
			"reasoning": "Hierarchical subtasks introduce complexity in UI, data relationships, and business logic (cascade completion, reordering, conversion). Each feature should be isolated as a subtask to ensure correctness and ease of testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement AI Service Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for: AI API research/selection, AIService implementation, prompt engineering, TaskGenerationForm UI, response parsing, error handling, loading states, retry mechanism, validation of AI output, feedback mechanism, and fallback to local templates.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating external AI services involves research, API integration, prompt design, error handling, and user feedback. Each area is a potential point of failure and should be handled as a separate subtask for reliability and maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Theme System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: ThemeProvider enhancement, Tailwind dark mode configuration, theme color variables, ThemeToggle with animation, system preference detection, component styling for both themes, transition implementation, accessibility checks, and theme preview in preferences.",
			"reasoning": "A robust theme system requires context management, CSS configuration, UI components, accessibility, and persistence. Each concern should be a subtask to ensure consistency and accessibility across the application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Accessibility Features",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for: ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management, skip links, heading hierarchy, high contrast mode, screen reader announcements, accessible error messages, label associations, keyboard shortcuts, screen reader testing, and color usage validation.",
			"reasoning": "Achieving WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is complex, requiring attention to multiple aspects of UI and UX. Each accessibility requirement (ARIA, keyboard, screen reader, contrast, etc.) should be a dedicated subtask to ensure thorough coverage and compliance."
